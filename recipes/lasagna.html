    <h4>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.

    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            
                <h4>For the meat sauce:</h4>
                <br>

               <li> 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li> 
               <li> 1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
               <li> 1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li> 
               <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
               </li> 
               <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
              <li> 1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>  
               <li> 3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li> 
               <li> 1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano </li>   
              <li>  1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li> 
             <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>   
              <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>  
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>    
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>    
            <li>Salt</li>    
                <br>
              <h4> To assemble the lasagna:
            </h4> 
               <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken) </li> 
             <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>   
              <li> 1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>  
              <li> 1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>  
        </ul>
        
      <h2>  For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <br>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        </ol>
